What is Topological Sort?Explain with Example.

Topological  Sort : Topological sorting is a graph sorting algorithm that sort the nodes of graph.
For example : 
Topological sort can be useful for any scheduling. for example if we want to schedule some cources for
a technology.

A--->B--->C 
 \   |    /
  \  |   /
   \ |  /
    >D<
here  in this directed graph suppose node A,B,C,D are 4 subjects in 
a department.its also a dependency graph. here in this graph one node is depend on another node.
If we want to do course B then first we have to finished course A then if we want to do course C then before we have to finished 
both Course A and B. and if we want to do course D then first we have to finish course A,B and C.
we can create a schedule of Course by this algorithm.


b ) A Topological sort cannot be implemented in a Directed Cyclic graph. n a DCG, there is at least one cycle, which means that it is impossible to find a vertex with no incoming edges
